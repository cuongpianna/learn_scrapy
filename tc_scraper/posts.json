Apple\u2019s Developer Transition Kit, which registered developers can apply for via its developer website, includes a Mac mini with an A12Z processor inside, running a pre-release version of macOS Big Sur.\n\nThe kit spec includes 16GB of RAM, as well as a 512GB SSD, and will come with Xcode preinstalled so that developers can get working on their apps right away. This is very much pre-release hardware, however \u2014 the first consumer Macs that run on Apple\u2019s in-house silicon won\u2019t ship until later this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a keynote event for the company\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday.\n\nApple will also still be selling Intel-based Macs, including new ones still in the pipeline, as it transitions to using its own chips, a shift which it expects will take two years to cover the full Mac lineup. But these developer kits will begin shipping out as early as this week to developers who are approved for the program, Cook said \u2014 indicating that Apple is very eager to do what it can to get developers on board with the shift.\n\nIn addition to the Developer Transition Kit, Apple has created a Quickstart program to help guide developers through the process of making their apps universal to work natively on the new Apple silicon. That will offer sample code forums and documentation about how to work with the new SoCs. The DTK itself, which includes the hardware, will cost $500, and Apple says it will prioritize those developers who already have an existing macOS application to receive the kits due to limited availability.\n\nDeveloping\u2026", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-is-releasing-a-mac-mini-with-an-apple-processor-for-developers-starting-this-week/"},

Users can also open the anti-tracker and view a privacy report, which details all of the trackers on the page.\u00a0\n\nThe page you\u2019re reading, for example, had more than 200 trackers on it when we checked.\n\nRival browsers, like Firefox and Brave, already have anti-tracking features built in.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest feature that tries to turn the tables on the targeted ad and tracking industry. As targeted advertising became more invasive over the years, Apple has responded by bundling features to its software, like its intelligence tracking prevention\u00a0technology and allowing Safari users to install content blockers that prevent ads and trackers from loading.\n\nThe new Safari features will land in the latest version of macOS Big Sur, expected out later this year.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-safari-ad-trackers/"},

Goyer, who said, \u201cPeople have been trying to make \u2018Foundation\u2019 for 50 years \u2026 It was the greatest science fiction work of all time.\u201d\n\nThe teaser also includes some hints about how Goyer and the rest of the creative team are approaching the adaptation.\n\nWhile the books cover hundreds of years and feature an ever-changing cast of characters, it looks like Jared Harris will have an ongoing role as Seldon. (Though who knows, maybe he\u2019ll disappear a few episodes in, just as he did in \u201cThe Crown.\u201d)\u00a0In addition, some key characters have been reconceived as women of color, and the whole thing looks much more visually spectacular than the action-light, dialogue-heavy stories.\n\n\u201cFoundation\u201d is due for release in 2021.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/watch-the-first-trailer-for-foundation-coming-to-apple-tv-in-2021/"},

As part of the settlement, Lyft has agreed to pay $42,000 to the four complainants and $40,000 to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nLyft is also now required to modify its wheelchair policy to clarify that drivers must help assist disabled people with wheelchairs, scooters and walkers. Lyft must also include information about its accessibility policies in the welcome email to new drivers, send quarterly reminders to drivers about the wheelchair policy and create an educational video about the wheelchair policy that highlights best practices for assisting riders.\n\nIf drivers fail to follow Lyft\u2019s wheelchair policy, they may be removed from the Lyft platform. Throughout the duration of the agreement, which lasts three years,\u00a0Lyft must provide written updates to the DOJ every six months regarding its compliance with the agreement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad that through this agreement, we will continue improving our policies and making it easier for people with foldable wheelchairs and other collapsible mobility devices to get around using Lyft,\u201d a Lyft spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cLyft is committed to maintaining an inclusive and welcoming community, and we\u2019re proud that many people with disabilities who were previously underserved by existing transportation options now use Lyft as a reliable, safe, and affordable way to get around.\u201d\n\nLyft has faced a number of accessibility-related discrimination lawsuits over the years. In the event that more lawsuits emerge, Lyft is now required to notify the DOJ within 30 days.\n\nCompetitor Uber has similarly faced its share of lawsuits pertaining to drivers discriminating against riders with wheelchairs. Both companies, however, have taken steps to rectify the problem. Last year, Lyft expanded its wheelchair-accessible vehicle service in New York while Uber has partnered with paratransit organizations to try to improve wait time for people with powered wheelchairs.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out the fine line Lyft is walking with its drivers, who are currently independent contractors, despite legislation in California that says otherwise. Since the start of the year, gig worker rights groups have urged companies like DoorDash, Uber, Lyft and Instacart to abide by AB 5. AB 5, which went into law earlier this year, outlines what type of worker can and cannot be classified as an independent contractor.\n\nThe law codifies the ruling established in\u00a0Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors.\n\nAccording to the\u00a0ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and is regularly engaged in work of some independently established trade or other similar business.\n\nStill, Lyft, Uber, Postmates, DoorDash and Instacart are funding a ballot measure\u00a0that would seek to make it legal for them to classify workers as independent contractors.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/lyft-settles-doj-lawsuit-alleging-violation-of-americans-with-disabilities-act/"},

Initial advertisers include\u00a0SmileDirectClub, The RealReal and Sweetgreen.\n\nThe announcement is coming at Hulu\u2019s virtual NewFronts presentation for advertisers. The Disney-owned streaming service is pitching this as an extension of an ad strategy that tries to find new viewer-friendly ways to advertise, for example with ads designed specifically for pausing or brand-sponsored, ad-free \u201cbinge watch\u201d episodes.\n\n\u201cFor our brand partners, the power of this ad experience lies in its ability to give viewers a simple way to engage with brands and take action on their mobile device,\u201d said Laura Nelson, senior vice president for cross portfolio solutions at Disney Advertising Sales, in a statement. \u201cUltimately, this helps advertisers get closer to their conversion goals with Streaming TV.\u201d\n\nHulu says it will also be integrating with Nielsen Media Impact to help advertisers measure the reach of their campaigns, and that it plans to launch something called Disney Hulu XP in October, which will give advertisers a way to buy video campaigns across Disney properties.\n\nAnd Hulu is using the presentation to highlight early data from a behavioral study of streaming audiences. It says streaming audiences tend to be younger, more affluent and more likely to be college educated than an average audience. It also says streaming audiences divide into streaming only (37%), streaming most (47%) and streaming also (16%) \u2014 and that three-quarters of streaming audiences want some degree of personalization from advertisers.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/hulu-announces-a-new-offer-focused-ad-format-called-gatewaygo/"},

The Singapore-based company, which is hardware-agnostic but also launched a close partnership with Rigetti Computing in 2018, today announced that it has raised a $3.23 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital India. Previous investors SGInnovate, Abies Ventures, DCVC, Qubit Protocol, Summer Capital and Posa CV also participated.\n\nAt its core, Horizon Quantum aims to democratize quantum development. Because there is very little about quantum computing that is intuitive, the company argues, it will take a new set of tools to help today\u2019s developers tackle quantum. What makes Horizon unique is that it takes conventional source code and then automatically analyzes that to figure out where a quantum computer could speed up an algorithm. Right now, the company can identify potential speedups in code written for Matlab and Octave.\n\n\u201cThe conventional approach to developing quantum applications is to explicitly specify the individual steps of a quantum algorithm, or to use a library where such explicit steps are specified. What makes our approach unique is that we construct quantum algorithms directly from conventional source code, automatically identifying places where it can be sped up,\u201d explained Si-Hui Tan, the chief science officer at Horizon Quantum. \u201cEverything that relates to quantum mechanics happens under-the-hood and on-the-fly in our compiler. This automation is what alleviates the need for any quantum knowledge. All our users have to do is to provide their program in a conventional programming language.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the company\u2019s tools also make life for experienced quantum software developers easier by giving them the tools to write more succinct code that is also automatically optimized for the underlying quantum processors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a compiler that can go all the way from conventional, classical, code down to the control signals sent to the\u00a0quantum hardware,\u201d Quantum Horizon CEO Joe Fitzsimons told me in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re still building, and we have a lot still to do, but we\u2019ve demonstrated key parts of the technology, from identifying speedups in classical code down to characterising and mitigating errors in quantum\u00a0processors. Our hope is that it will make\u00a0quantum\u00a0computing more easily accessible for the millions of software developers out there, and will allow us to leverage\u00a0quantum\u00a0computing in new domains (we specifically think about domains like geophysics for the energy sector and computational fluid dynamics for aerospace and automotive sectors).\u201d\n\nThe company says it will use the new funding to help bring its technology to market and engage with its early customers.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/horizon-quantum-raises-3-23m-for-its-quantum/"},

The EV routing feature, which will be available in the newest version of iOS, is one of several improvements that Apple is making to Maps.\n\nApple unveiled the new feature Monday at a virtual version of WWDC 2020, the company\u2019s annual developer conference.\n\nThe EV routing aims to eliminate range anxiety \u2014 the fear of running out of charge \u2014 by showing charging stations compatible to a user\u2019s electric vehicle along their route. Maps on iOS 14 will track the user\u2019s current charge and factor in things like elevation and whether to automatically add charging stops along their\u00a0route, Apple senior director Stacey Lysik said Monday during WWDC 2020.\n\nApple said it\u2019s working with a number of manufacturers to support easy routing in their vehicles, including BMW and Ford.

The studio has been working closely with Facebook and Oculus for a while as a publishing partner, this acquisition brings the team into the Oculus fold as they prep the release of a full sequel to Lone Echo. Facebook notably did not give any updates on the status of Lone Echo II, which has had its launch repeatedly delayed after initially announcing a 2019 launch date. The title is expected to be released sometime this year.\n\nDeal terms weren\u2019t disclosed though Facebook says they are bringing the entire team onboard. The studio will operate independently out of their Irvine, California and Portland, Oregon offices.\n\nLone Echo has been renowned as one of the more finessed and innovative VR titles, with both single and multi-player iterations ranking high among VR users. The series has also been embraced in the eSports world, which hasn\u2019t always been receptive to virtual reality games. Before fully embracing VR, Ready at Dawn was developing console titles including several licensed games in the God of War series.\n\nFacebook previously announced the acquisition of Beat Games, the studio behind Beat Saber, and Sanzaru Games, the developer behind the Rift game Asgard\u2019s Wrath. Facebook\u2019s acquisition strategy gives some of the more visible VR studios greater breathing room to continue investing in upcoming VR titles without getting overwhelmed by staying afloat.\n\nAdvances in the VR space have been slow-moving and though VR developers have seen some usage bumps from shelter-in-place, a general lack of hardware availability has left a ceiling on growth numbers. As other VR hardware makers seem to slowly pull back on the space and other immersive platforms like Magic Leap exit the consumer arena, life is becoming even more difficult for VR developers looking to create high-quality titles.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/facebook-acquires-vr-studio-behind-lone-echo/"},

At its virtual Worldwide Developer Conference keynote this morning, Apple announced the next version of iMessage will support a number of popular features found in rival messaging apps like Slack or even Facebook\u2019s Messenger, among others. This includes added support for common features like inline replies, pins, and mentions, plus updated customizations for group chats, expanded Memoji, improved search, and more.\n\nWith the new inline replies feature, iMessage users in a group chat will be able to respond to specific messages using threads \u2014 a feature common to a number of other top messaging apps, including Slack. With inline replies, users can opt to view the replies within the full conversation, or you can opt to view them as their own thread.\n\nTo make it easier for other iMessage users to know who a message was meant for in a group chat, iMessage is adding support for Mentions. But unlike the @ mention format on some apps and social platforms, like Twitter, iMessage only requires you type someone\u2019s name \u2014 no extra symbol required.\n\nThe app will pop up a contact suggestion, which you can then click to select. The person\u2019s name is then highlighted in blue in your text to indicate you\u2019ve directed your comment to them.\n\nThe best part, however, is that you\u2019ll be able to configure the Messages app to only notify you when you\u2019ve been directly mentioned in a conversation. That will help you better keep up with busier chats you may have set on mute, without missing anything important.\n\nThe design for Group chats has also changed, where now the profile icons for the most recently active people are shown the largest.\n\nGroup chats can also be customized with a personal photo or emoji as their main photo. Within the conversation, you\u2019ll see the group members\u2019 profile icons spread out around this main image.\n\nAnother new feature, Pinned Conversations, will allow you to keep your most important iMessage chats at the top of the screen. This way, you can more easily jump back into your most frequently accessed conversations, like your BFF or family group chat, for example. But it also gives you a way to quickly continue a conversation with an important contact, like a significant other, spouse, or child, or anyone else you message often.\n\nAs new messages arrives in these group chats, they\u2019ll display right at the top of the screen. You can even see the typing indicator appear when someone is texting you.\n\nThis feature will be particularly useful for those who primarily and regularly use iMessage to keep track of their conversations, but often miss important messages in a long list of unreads. It also gives you an easy way to reduce screen time, by giving you a single place to quickly make sure you haven\u2019t missed an urgent message, without having to scroll through your list of unreads and catch up.\n\nIn addition, Apple is updating its Memoji with\u00a020 new hair and headwear styles, face coverings, and more age options, plus 3 new Memoji stickers (hug, fist bump, and blush).\n\nOn Mac, the Messages app will also gain access to the new features including Inline Replies, Pinned Conversations, and Mentions, as well as iMessage\u2019s Message Effects, the ability to customize Memoji, a new photo picker and #images. Apple promises also a revamped Search experience which better organizes results into links, photos, and matching items.\n\nThe new features will roll out with the release of iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur later this year.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apples-imessage-update-takes-cues-from-slack-with-mentions-pins-threads-and-more/"},

The restrictions are intended to last until the end of the year, which would disrupt the government\u2019s typical process of awarding new visas at the beginning of the national fiscal calendar in October.\n\nOfficials from the Trump administration told the Wall Street Journal that the move is intended to protect American jobs, but executives in the technology industry have long warned that visa restrictions would hurt the nation\u2019s ability to compete in industries that have both strategic and financial significance as engines of economic growth.\n\nTech officials have even cited immigration curbs as a factor that would force companies to relocate more of their operations overseas in an effort to hire and retain top technology talent.\n\nAccording to news reports, officials expect these new restrictions to last until the end of the year, and expand the immigration bans that the President put in place in April that blocked family members of U.S. citizens from immigrating and slashed the number of visas available to high-skilled\u00a0 workers looking to immigrate to the US.\n\nEstimates provided to the Wall Street Journal indicate that roughly 525,000 people will be unable to enter the country as a result of the expanded travel restrictions including 170,000 green card holders barred from entering the U.S. since April. The Trump administration official quoted by the Journal called the initiative an \u201cAmerica-first recovery\u201d that would potentially open up 500,000 jobs for out-of-work Americans.\n\nTechnology executives are already voicing their displeasure with the reported ban. \u201cBanning all H1B [sic] visas means CEOs like me have to open offices and hire more people in countries like Canada  that allow immigration. This visa ban is morally wrong and economically stupid,\u201d wrote Anshu Sharma,  the chief executive officer of the technology startup Skyflow.\n\nInvestors are also up-in-arms about the decision\u2019s impact on America\u2019s ability to compete.\n\n\u201cWhether his administration realizes it or not, they creating a significant handicap for US innovation. Our most innovative and impactful portfolio companies and many of their employees started as H-1b holders,\u201d wrote Stonly Baptiste, the co-founder of technology investment fund, Urban.us. \u201cWe literally couldn\u2019t have built our portfolio in an environment without H-1B. And we\u2019re not even an immigrant focused fund.\u201d\n\nAlso on the chopping block are H-2B visas, which are used to let short-term seasonal workers in landscaping and non-farm jobs into the country, J-1 jobs for short-term workers like camp counselors and au pairs and L-1 visas for corporate company transfers.\n\n\u201cBy limiting the talent pool for American companies, the US government is hindering our ability to build strong, defensible organizations,\u201d wrote Andy Coravos, the chief executive officer of the healthcare-focused startup Elektra Labs, in a direct message. \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s Executive Order to suspend foreign work visas is not only based in fear, but also perpetuates fear within our community, and is not in our society\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nHealthcare workers, coronavirus researchers, food supply workers in food packaging are all exempt from the visa suspensions.\n\nTechnology executives aren\u2019t the only ones coming out against the tighter immigration rules. A group of nine Republican senators including South Carolina\u2019s powerful senior senator, Lindsey Graham, and Texas Senator John Cornyn, issued a joint letter on May 27, which pleaded with the President to reconsider the rumored immigration restrictions.\n\n\u201cGuest workers are needed to boost American business, not take American jobs,\u201d they wrote.\n\nUpdate June 22: Linked to the published Executive Order.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/president-trump-reportedly-will-sign-executive-order-temporarily-suspending-work-visas-for-h-1b-holders/"},
{"title": "Google employees demand company stop selling tech to police", "author": "Megan Rose Dickey", "published_at": "2020-06-22 15:17:25", "content": "A growing group of more than 1,666 Google  employees is demanding Google stop selling its technology to police departments, TechCrunch has learned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed to know that Google is still selling to police forces, and advertises its connection with police forces as somehow progressive, and seeks more expansive sales rather than severing ties with police and joining the millions who want to defang and defund these institutions,\u201d employees wrote in a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. \u201cWhy help the institutions responsible for the knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck to be more effective organizationally? Not only that, but the same Clarkstown police force being advertised by Google as a success story has been sued multiple times for illegal surveillance of Black Lives Matter organizers.\u201d\n\nGoogle, for example, has publicized how Clarkstown Police Department uses G Suite for sharing information and digital evidence. Meanwhile, Google is also a partner and donor to the Seattle police foundation and its venture capital arm, GV, has invested in startups working on artificial intelligence technology for police.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to work that makes a meaningful difference to combat systemic racism, and our employees have made over 500 product suggestions in recent weeks, which we are reviewing,\u201d a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cOn this one, we were the first major company to decide, years ago, to not make facial recognition commercially available and we have very clear AI Principles that prohibit its use or sale for surveillance. We have longstanding terms of use for generally available computing platforms like Gmail, GSuite and Google Cloud Platform, and these products will remain available for Governments and local authorities, including police departments, to use.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, employees go on to say they want to be proud of the company they work for. They also want Google to speak to their values, the letter says.\n\n\u201cThe racist legacy of police across the United States goes all the way back to its roots, when police forces emerged to protect the wealth gotten from slavery and genocide,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWe have a long way to go to address the full legacy of racism but to begin with \u2014 we should not be in the business of profiting from racist policing. We should not be in the business of criminalizing Black existence while we chant that Black Lives Matter. We, the undersigned Googlers, call on you to stop making our technology available to police forces.\u201d\u00a0\n\nGoogle employees have been able to successfully pressure the company to drop contracts in the past. After employees petitioned Google to stop working on Project Maven, Google decided not to renew its contract with the Pentagon for that project. Then, in October 2018, Google dropped out of the running for JEDI, the big cloud computing contract with the Pentagon.\n\nGoogle is not the only tech company that has contracted with police departments and other law enforcement agencies. Salesforce, for example, has long held a contract with Customs and Border Protection, despite protest from employees and others.\n\nSome positive change, however, has occurred. Earlier this month, IBM said it would no longer sell its facial recognition technology, which has become a tool for policing and mass surveillance. Meanwhile, Microsoft recently said it won\u2019t sell facial recognition technology to police without federal regulation and Amazon halted police use of its facial recognition tech for one year. These were direct responses to the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.\n\nIn response to Floyd\u2019s death, Pichai noted in an email to employees that \u201cOur Black community is hurting, and many of us are searching for ways to stand up for what we believe, and reach out to people we love to show solidarity.\u201d\n\nHe also outlined how Google will give $12 million to racial justice organizations. Since then, Pichai has elaborated on Google\u2019s commitments to racial justice. Internally, for example, Google committed to improving diverse representation at the leadership level by 30% by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe want Google to take real steps to help dismantle racism,\u201d employees wrote. \u201cWe as a society have moved past the point where saying Black Lives Matter is enough, we need to show it in our thinking, in our words and in our actions that Black lives do matter to us.\u201d", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/google-employees-demand-company-stop-selling-tech-to-police/"},
{"title": "Apple will soon let developers challenge App Store rules", "author": "Devin Coldewey", "published_at": "2020-06-22 17:30:39", "content": "Apple  has announced an upcoming change to App Store rules that could mark a major shift in how the marketplace operates. Developers will soon be able to challenge not just the rejection of an app, but the rule that prompted that rejection. Bug fixes will also no longer be held up by rule violations.\n\nIn a blog post about changes for apps and developers, Apple noted these major additions with remarkably little fanfare:\n\nApp Store rules have been in the headlines this week due to a fracas over monetization that saw the new email service Hey rejected from the platform over a reluctance to share its subscription revenue with Apple.\n\nWhile the issue is hardly new and it seems unlikely that a high-profile play like Hey (from Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson) was unaware that this would happen, this isn\u2019t the first criticism of Apple\u2019s one-size-fits-all business model for apps.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller said the company was not considering any changes to the rules that would allow Hey \u2014 and other apps with similar models \u2014 to operate on the App Store without surrendering a significant cut of its income.\n\nBut while Apple may not be considering changing the rules immediately, it seems from today\u2019s announcement that the rules may change eventually. Exactly how feedback from developers would be solicited, processed, and weighed is not addressed, but we can probably expect to hear more during this week\u2019s many developer sessions (and during which suggestions will no doubt begin to be submitted).\n\nThe second change takes a bit of the pressure off app developers that may find themselves, as Hey did, blocked from providing security updates because of business concerns. Separating the two seems only right, since Apple doesn\u2019t want its users at risk because negotiations haven\u2019t concluded. It shrinks the size of the stick that Apple wields against recalcitrant developers, but ultimately results in less risk for everyone involved.\n\nThe changes to App Store rules will be arriving this summer, and more details will surely be forthcoming before then.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-will-soon-let-developers-challenge-app-store-rules/"},

The campaign issued a set of actionable demands for the company, calling for Facebook to stop collecting ad revenue from \u201cmisinformation and harmful content,\u201d demanding more resources for users targeted by racism and other forms of hate and asking the company to provide moderators for private groups.\n\nThe campaign was coordinated by the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Color of Change, Free Press and Sleeping Giants, an organization behind many successful ad boycott pressure campaigns in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe are asking all businesses to stand in solidarity with our most deeply held American values of freedom, equality and justice and not advertise on Facebook\u2019s services in July,\u201d the campaign\u2019s website states.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s send Facebook a powerful message: Your profits will never be worth promoting hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism and violence.\u201d\n\nFacebook has come under frequent scrutiny in recent years for its failure to eradicate misinformation and hateful content. As TechCrunch previously reported, white supremacist content\u00a0flourished on the platform, and Facebook and Instagram only moved to ban white nationalism and white separatism one year ago.\n\nFacebook has also signaled its reluctance to take action against President Trump, who has frequently shared misinformation intended to discourage voters in recent weeks. In a surprising turn for a company that usually keeps internal dissent quiet, Facebook employees openly criticized their employer\u2019s decision to take no action on a violent threat from the president against protesters in the days following George Floyd\u2019s killing.\n\nThe threat, which warned \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d echoed racist threats by authorities made during the civil rights movement.\u00a0Twitter\u2019s decision to attach fact-checking labels or hide some of the president\u2019s tweets at the time served to further highlight Facebook\u2019s own reluctance to moderate its platform.\n\nOn the #StopHateforProfit website, the campaign explains the reasoning behind targeting Facebook for the boycott:\n\nAs media, tech and other businesses face long overdue reckonings around racism, the outdoor community is undergoing its own self-examination. Even as companies like REI and a growing handful of independent initiatives make efforts to highlight a diverse community beyond the straight white men who have long dominated the image of the outdoors, the adventure community must grapple with its reputation for toxicity and being hostile to change.\n\nIf change is difficult in the outdoor industry, forcing a tech platform with unprecedented resources and power to change is more akin to moving a mountain. Facebook faces regular criticism from the press and its users, but high profile efforts by brands forgoing ads on its platforms are something new. If they\u2019ll build more momentum or last beyond the month isn\u2019t clear, but we\u2019ll be watching to see where the effort goes\u2014and if Facebook considers making any of the reasonable changes its critics are demanding.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/facebook-instagram-rei-patagonia-north-face-brands-join-stophateforprofit-boycott/"},
{"title": "Apple will let you emulate old apps and run iOS apps on ARM Macs", "author": "Romain Dillet", "published_at": "2020-06-22 12:01:29", "content": "Apple  has announced a major shift for the Mac. In the future, the company is going to switch from Intel CPU to Apple\u2019s own silicon, based on ARM architecture. If you are a developer or if you run obscure enterprise apps, you may have a lot of questions about how it\u2019s going to work.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll be able to compile your app to run both on Intel-based Macs and ARM-based Macs. You can ship those apps with both executables using a new format called Universal 2. If you\u2019ve been using a Mac for a while, you know that Apple used the same process when it switched from PowerPC CPUs to Intel CPUs \u2014 one app, two executables.\n\nAs for unoptimized software, you\u2019ll still be able to run those apps. But its performances won\u2019t be as good as what you\u2019d get from a native ARM-ready app. Apple is going to ship Rosetta 2, an emulation layer that lets you run old apps on new Macs.\n\nWhen you install an old app, your Mac will examine the app and try to optimize it for your ARM processor. This way, there will be some level of optimization even before you open the app.\n\nBut what if it\u2019s a web browser or a complicated app with just-in-time code? Rosetta 2 can also translate instructions from x86 to ARM on the fly, while you\u2019re running the app.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a developer working on code that is going to run on servers, Apple is also working on a set of virtualization tools. You\u2019ll be able to run Linux and Docker on an ARM Mac.\n\nAs a bonus, users will also be able to access a much larger library of apps. \u201cMac users can for the first time run iOS and iPadOS apps on the Mac,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said.\n\nWhile the company didn\u2019t share a lot of details, Apple isn\u2019t talking about Catalyst, its own framework that makes it easier to port iOS apps to macOS. You should be able to download and run apps even if the developer never optimized those apps for macOS.\n\nThe transition is going to take a while \u2014\u00a0around two years. The first ARM-based Mac will ship by the end of the year. There will be a quick start program for developers interested in porting apps to ARM-based Macs. In addition to documentation and a private forum, Apple will send you a custom-made Mac Mini with an A12Z system on a chip. This way, you can test your apps on an actual Mac with an ARM chip.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-will-let-you-emulate-old-apps-and-run-ios-apps-on-arm-macs/"},
{"title": "Microsoft kills Mixer, will push users to Facebook Gaming", "author": "Lucas Matney", "published_at": "2020-06-22 11:47:32", "content": "Microsoft  is killing its Twitch competitor Mixer next month and is partnering with Facebook to push its users toward the Facebook Gaming service.\n\nThe app is winding down on July 22. The sudden move comes after Microsoft has dumped considerable efforts into its gaming-centric streaming service, acquiring streaming rights to some of the biggest esports personalities like Ninja and Shroud. Microsoft couldn\u2019t spend its way into meaningfully competition with Amazon\u2019s Twitch and Alphabet\u2019s YouTube Gaming.\n\nThe company launched its Mixer service in 2017 after acquiring the gaming startup Beam Interactive in 2016.\n\nMicrosoft announced that when the service sunsets, it will be transitioning partnerships to Facebook Gaming and redirecting its users to the service as well. The partnership between the two is a T-Mobile and Sprint partnership of sorts, as the two were clearly trailing far behind the YouTube Gaming/Twitch duopoly. The Facebook partnership goes deeper than just watching streams; Microsoft will integrate their xCloud game-streaming service into Facebook Gaming so users can quickly play titles that they see inside the service.\n\nAccording to an interview in The Verge, top streamers like Ninja won\u2019t be forced to migrate to Facebook Gaming and will be able to rejoin Twitch if they choose. Microsoft\u2019s gaming chief Phil Spencer pinned the shutdown on the service\u2019s inability to catch up with competitors:\n\nAccording to data from SensorTower, year-to-date downloads of the app on the App Store and Google Play were down 23% in 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, with the app seeing 3.4 million downloads this year. The company says their data shows that the app has been installed about 21 million times in total.\n\nThe announcement came in the midst of Apple\u2019s WWDC keynote, so fair to say that Microsoft was likely aiming to minimize attention on this high-profile shutdown.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/microsoft-kills-mixer-its-twitch-competitor/"},

But unlike a simple Instagram story\u2019s Q&A session, Capsule provides a full platform for designing the Q&A session, branding the content, curating the responses from users and tracking the resulting data. But the most notable feature is Capsule\u2019s automated editing process that adds branding, effects and music to the final product, allowing brands to skip the post-production process and more quickly publish their video.\n\nThe product comes from the same team behind the animated GIF capture tool and social network Phhhoto, which eventually lost out to Instagram\u2019s clone, Boomerang. Following Phhhoto\u2019s shutdown in late 2017, the team pivoted to an experiential marketing business, Hypno, that provided photo booths, plus other camera platforms and interactive experiences, for live events, retail and attractions.\n\nThe idea for the new startup directly emerged from the challenges now facing Hypno in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cCapsule was born out of the need for some of our events and live experiences customers to figure out a way to activate their audiences because they couldn\u2019t do it in real life,\u201d explains co-founder Champ Bennett. \u201cThe Hypno business pretty much dried up in terms of its opportunities as soon as the pandemic hit,\u201d he says.\n\nThe team refocused its efforts on the new software platform instead, and received an immediate, overwhelming response from its existing customers. It also quickly added new ones \u2014 including those outside the live events space.\n\nIn the two months following its MVP launch, Capsule has been generating revenue from its now 35,000 users, including some big-name customers like Netflix, Samsung, Chicago Bulls and a handful of colleges and universities that wanted to create solutions for virtual graduations. Consumers, meanwhile, have also used the product for virtual birthdays, weddings and baby showers.\n\nThe platform itself works something like a Squarespace for the video Q&A format.\n\nTo use Capsule, the brand will first pick a template that it can customize to match its current campaign by changing the logos, colors, buttons, backgrounds and URLs.\n\nThey then choose their own questions and prompts designed to get their customers/users/community members talking.\n\nTo respond, users visit the Capsule URL \u2014 which can be a custom domain for an extra fee \u2014 to record and upload videos via their phone or laptop. These videos can only be a max of 60 seconds in length to keep the content short and snappy.\n\nBrands can curate the responses they want to use in the resulting product, aka the \u201ccapsule.\u201d They\u2019ll also have access to the raw video footage for use elsewhere on social media, if needed.\n\nCapsule\u2019s best trick is that it instantly and automatically processes the video, adding music, lower-third graphics and a preroll and a post-roll, so the video looks professionally edited.\n\n\u201cIt makes everybody look a little better than what they would normally look like if they were just recording right from their phone \u2014 which generally looks pretty raw and unedited,\u201d explains Bennett. \u201cThat editing feature is the magic of that whole thing, as it makes it feel really special.\u201d\n\nThe automated editing involves a scripting language the Capsule team created, which includes a set of instructions on how to process a given video. Capsule\u2019s customers simply select the \u201ctype\u201d of video they want, and Capsule does the rest.\n\n\u201cOne might be really energetic, with flashing graphics and pumping music. And one might be a little bit more somber and may have an acoustic guitar playing behind it,\u201d Bennett notes. \u201cUltimately, what will happen is when you create a Capsule, you\u2019ll be able to pick that that feel.\u201d\n\nRight now, Capsule offers 10 of these \u201ctemplates,\u201d but is working to have around 50 available within the next couple of months.\n\nDepending on the type of solution a brand needs, Capsule\u2019s service can cost anywhere from $10 per month to as much as $20,000 per year. It currently works via the web and mobile web, but Capsule is developing an iPhone app that will allow the capture of higher-quality video.\n\nWhile the original focus was to create a new engagement platform for brands that have lost the ability to host live events, the range of post-COVID use cases is continuing to grow. Netflix, for example, ran a focus group using Capsule to ask questions and get video, instead of written responses from viewers. Will Ferrell used Capsule to leave a video message for graduates. Media company OkayAfrica\u2019s community used Capsule to talk about the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, organized in thematic sections.\n\nBennett says the company is also thinking about how Capsule can be used to provide a platform for people\u2019s voices who may not otherwise be heard.\n\nFollowing its launch, it\u2019s clear Capsule became a more flexible format than perhaps originally envisioned. But to what extent customers\u2019 usage will change over time remains less certain. If a coronavirus vaccine is developed, for example, the need for video to stand in for live events may not be as in demand as it is now, for example. Of course, no one knows when that time will come at this point.\n\nIn addition to Bennett, Capsule\u2019s co-founders include Russell Armand and Joseph Jorgensen, also of Phhhoto and Hypno. The company is planning to spin out Capsule from Hypno and is already receiving inbound interest from investors. Capsule has not closed a seed round at this time.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/capsules-video-qa-platform-helps-brands-reach-their-community-in-the-post-covid-era/"},

{"title": "Apple unveils iOS 14 with home screen widgets", "author": "Romain Dillet", "published_at": "2020-06-22 10:28:13", "content": "During the virtual keynote of WWDC, Apple shared the first details about iOS 14, the next major version of iOS that is going to be released later this year. The most visual change is that the home screen is getting widgets.\n\n\u201cThis year, we spent time rethinking the iconic experience of the iPhone,\u201d SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. \u201cWe\u2019ve rethought some of the core elements of iOS.\u201d\n\nAs you know, iOS already comes with widgets in the Today view \u2014 swipe left on the home screen to access widgets. Widgets have been completely redesigned. Some of them take the full width of the device, others can be limited to a small square. You can now have two columns of widgets.\n\nBut widgets are no longer limited to the Today view. You can drag them out of the Today view and drop them on your home screen. There\u2019s also a new widget gallery that lets you add widgets when you\u2019re moving icons around on the home screen.\n\nAs for home screen organization, Apple knows that a lot of people have an endless list of icons, making the home screen harder to use. Apple is adding some smart organization features.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s home screen is great but as we get more apps we end up with this \u2014 lots and lots of pages,\u201d Federighi said.\n\nAt the end of the home screen pages, there\u2019s a new page called the App Library. All the apps that aren\u2019t on your home screen are sorted in automatic categories, such as Apple Arcade.\n\nThe other feature that is going to have an impact on multitasking and the home screen is that you can use picture in picture on the iPhone just like on the iPad. You can keep a video in a corner of the screen and do something else on your phone.\n\nMessages is getting a much-needed update to compete with WhatsApp, Telegram and other popular messaging apps. You can now pin conversations at the top to access them more easily.\n\nConversations themselves are getting an upgrade as you can reply to individual messages. You can then tap on the reply to see the conversation as a separate thread. People can mention you and you can filter your notifications to mentions only.\n\nEach conversation is now more customizable. You can set a photo or an emoji for a conversation. Apple also shows the icons of your contacts in a specific conversation. The most active people get a bigger icon.\n\nMemoji is getting some new options, such as new hair options, new age options and face covers. There are new Memoji stickers as well, such as a hug sticker, a fist bump sticker and a blushing sticker.\n\nApple is also adding new features to Maps. While the U.S. has received updated data, Apple is going to roll out better maps in other countries, based on its own data set. Up next, the U.K., Ireland and Canada will get much more detailed maps. And this is just the first step as the new data set opens up more possibilities.\n\n\u201cIn iOS 14, the Maps team will be working with some of the most trusted brands to bring you guides,\u201d Meg Frost, director Product Design of Apple Maps, said. You\u2019ll soon be able to browse information from AllTrails, Zagat and more sources.\n\nIn some cities, Apple is going to roll out cycling as a transportation mode. It\u2019ll take into consideration elevation. Cycling will be available in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Shanghai and Beijing at first. For walking directions, you can now say to avoid steps and steep hills.\n\nFor drivers, there will be more features as well, such as EV routing and more information about restricted city centers. And if your car supports CarPlay, there will be more types of apps in the future, such as parking apps, EV charging apps and food-ordering apps.\n\nCar manufacturers will also be able to let you use your iPhone as a car key. It leverages the U1 chip on the most recent iPhone models. Interestingly, you\u2019ll be able to share your key with a friend by sending it over iMessage.\n\nWhile Siri can be hit or miss, Apple is still iterating on the voice assistant. Siri will no longer take over the entire screen when you trigger it. It\u2019ll be a small bubble at the bottom of the screen, which doesn\u2019t obstruct the rest of the screen. Results appear at the top of the screen and appear like a notification.\n\nYou can now ask Siri to send audio messages using iMessage. And if you hate audio messages like me, keyboard dictation has been improved. Your voice is now processed on device, which should help when it comes to speed.\n\nSiri lets you translate words already, but Apple is going one step further by releasing a Translate app. Like Google Translate, you can have a conversation in two different languages. You can translate from voice-to-text-to-voice. If you rotate your iPhone in landscape mode, each person has one side of the screen.\n\nYou know that feeling. When your friends ask you to download another app, you don\u2019t want to open the App Store. That\u2019s why Apple is launching App Clips. They are sort of mini apps that you can launch without installing an app. It\u2019s a small part of an app that you can easily share.\n\nThere are many ways to share App Clips. You can launch those apps from the web, from Messages, from Maps, from NFC tags or from QR codes. Get ready to see stickers at caf\u00e9s, on scooters or in museums. Scan a code or tap your phone on it and you get an app-like experience. If you want to dive deeper, you can download the full app from the App Library.\n\nApple is adding a slew of new privacy-centric features. For instance, there\u2019ll be a new dot in the top-right corner to indicate that an app is using or has recently used your microphone or camera. There will be new privacy cards in the App Store description pages to tell you how your data is used before you download an app. Apps will also have to ask before they track you across other apps and websites.\n\nAs always, iOS 14 will be tested over the summer and should be available to everyone in September.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-unveils-ios-14-with-home-screen-widgets/"},
{"title": "To create the jobs our economy needs, the US must expand immigration", "author": "Sophie Alcorn", "published_at": "2020-06-22 09:34:20", "content": "As a second-generation immigration attorney, I\u2019ve spent three decades helping people navigate the U.S. immigration system. At my Silicon Valley firm, we support tech entrepreneurs and business owners seeking business-nurturing opportunities that only the U.S. can offer.\n\nMy clients are innovators with big American dreams, founding companies that will create thousands of new jobs \u2014 jobs that our economy sorely needs.\n\nPresident Trump announced his intent to suspend all U.S. immigration amid the COVID-19 pandemic and new restrictions may be coming any day. Severely limiting immigration would be a grave mistake.\n\nThe success of America is in large part due to the ingenuity of global transplants. The world has no shortage of brilliant scientists, inventors and entrepreneurs. For decades, they have sought to bring their ideas and their labor to the U.S. We are short-sighted to turn them away.\n\nWe are in a greater economic crisis than any of us have ever experienced. As of this writing, more than 40 million Americans have filed unemployment claims. We can create jobs through innovation and immigration spurs innovation. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, immigrants are measurably more likely than nonimmigrants to start businesses. Immigrants founded 25% of the venture-backed American companies that went public between 1990 and 2005, and 33% of those that have gone public since 2006. More than half of America\u2019s \u201cunicorn\u201d start-ups \u2014 those valued at $1 billion or more \u2014 are immigrant-founded.\n\nContrary to what Trump claims, America is already unduly hostile to those seeking to put down roots here and live their American dream. Just one example: Although many of the world\u2019s promising minds come to the U.S. to pursue advanced degrees, they overwhelmingly don\u2019t have a way to stay here once their schooling is done. Students who aspire to start businesses here after graduating are forced instead to leave our shores and start over from scratch.\n\nEven for the most starry-eyed innovators, the American dream cannot be attained. Many of the world\u2019s best and brightest, after hitting the U.S. immigration brick wall, will end up being wooed away to other countries. They will take their companies public there, contributing new jobs and tax revenue in their second-choice homes. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to bleed jobs, with no end in sight to either the pandemic or its cascading economic effects.\n\nAlternatively, for people hoping to enter the U.S. having already embarked on their careers, the coveted H-1B visa is often the only option. Available only to those with specialized skills and a job offer from an American employer, H-1B visas can provide a springboard for ambitious innovators wishing to establish themselves professionally in the U.S. But getting one of these visas requires literally winning a lottery, and the lucky few who are selected have to wait months to actually come here, testing the patience of the employers on whom their visas depend.\n\nAmbitious entrepreneurs could go anywhere in the world. Many countries bend over backward to welcome them, with immigration perks and financial grants to attract start-up founders. But even though we try to shut them out, the world\u2019s best entrepreneurs still fight to come here \u2014 with good reason. There are Silicon Alleys and Silicon Beaches elsewhere, but none of them have the same concentration of capital, mentors and skilled professionals. For people who want to start unicorn companies that are really going to change the world, the U.S. has the necessary ingredients to take their ideas to scale \u2014 including, now, a rapidly growing pool of job-seekers eager to fill new positions. Additionally, immigrant founders tend to be more open to hiring diverse workforces, thus increasing BIPOC recruitment and retention efforts at scale.\n\nPerhaps in a different climate, we could afford to turn up our noses at innovation from overseas. But not anymore. To truly protect our country, revitalize our economy and create opportunity for all, we would be wise to open our borders wider, not slam them shut.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/to-create-the-jobs-our-economy-needs-the-us-must-expand-immigration/"},

The price goes up on June 26, and that means you have just five days left to buy your ticket and keep $50 in your wallet.\n\nWe created TC Early Stage specifically for founders of early-stage startups \u2014 from pre-seed through Series A. Attendees can choose from more than 50 sessions that address vital issues that early founders wrestle with as they get their startups off the ground. Each session includes lively, interactive Q&A.\n\nExperts spanning the startup spectrum will lead sessions on core topics ranging from fundraising, tech stack and growth marketing to term sheet construction, recruitment, product management and PR.

Every decision you make about your tech stack affects how it will hold up, and evolve, over time. Hear from HappyFunCorp\u2019s co-founder and CEO Ben Schippers and CTO Jon Evans about how you can avoid regretting those decisions.\n\nHow to get your first yes \u2014 Fundraising can be a bit like dominoes. Once you get one investor on board, it\u2019s much easier to bring others along for the ride. But getting that first \u201cyes\u201d can be the most difficult part. Hear the dos and don\u2019ts of hyper-early-stage fundraising from Cyan Banister, seed-stage investor and partner at Founders Fund.\n\nHere\u2019s where you really need to pay attention.

With an upcoming software update, the iPhone can soon unlock and start a car like a standard key. If your car supports it, that is.\n\nDetails are slim at the moment.\n\nInitially, only the upcoming BMW 5 Series will support this feature. Apple expects other manufacturers to support it in the future, too.\n\nSecurity is paramount. Apple says the so-called digital key will live in the secure environment on the owner\u2019s iPhone. It\u2019s not stored in the cloud, but locally on the iPhone. This is the same secure enclave that stores the owner\u2019s Face ID and Wallet information.\n\nOnce the key is added to the iPhone, owners can share the key with other iPhones through iMessage. When sharing, the owner can limit the permissions of the key. Again, details are light, but it seems like this will allow parents to restrict the use of a vehicle to teenagers. Automakers have long offered similar options and enable the owner to put a cap on the rate of speed a person can drive, the volume of the radio and other features. It\u2019s unclear at this point the extent of Apple\u2019s permissions.\n\nApple said that the company is working with car makers to integrate the iPhone\u2019s U1 ultra-wideband chip into this system. If implemented, the range would be greatly increased. Without the U1 chip, the owner would need to hold the phone close to the car so the car can read the phone\u2019s NFC chip. With U1, the range increases dramatically. Apple gave the example of an owner walking up to a car and unlocking it without taking the phone out of a bag.\n\nThis feature will roll out with iOS 14 but will come to iOS 13 devices, too.\n\nA similar feature is available on Android devices with BMW cars.

Traditional IPOs rely on underwriters \u2014\u00a0 that also charge hefty fees \u2014 to determine opening share-price, and that can swing widely once the stock actually goes to market.\n\nThe NYSE touts direct listings as a less costly way to go public and one that could lead to a less volatile price discovery process.\n\nOn when the NYSE\u2019s proposed direct listing proposal could be approved or (denied), \u201cThe timeline is up to the SEC. Their first deadline for any action is this Saturday,\u201d said Tuttle.\n\nUpdates to the listing process are just some of the changes that could come to New York Stock Exchange.

The big change is how Apple\u2019s stock apps are being designed with an eye toward sidebars and drop-down menus. It all sounds pretty dry, but it brings a decidedly more complex and macOS-esque design to the iPad making better use of the screen real estate. Apple specifically highlighted design updates to the Photos, Files and Calendar apps.\n\nThe design changes address one of the common complaints around computing on the iPad; that users aren\u2019t able to harness the full power of the device because apps are still being held to iPhone design paradigms. With the company\u2019s new support for multitouch external input like the new Magic Keyboard\u2019s trackpad, Apple\u2019s design needs are moving toward more productivity-minded interfaces that fit more on a single screen.

{"title": "iOS 14 reimagines how you find and use apps with App Clips, widgets and an App Library", "author": "Sarah Perez", "published_at": "2020-06-22 10:36:17", "content": "At Apple\u2019s all-virtual Worldwide Developers Conference, the company introduced several new iOS features designed to help you clean up the mess of icons on your iPhone\u2019s home screen. With iOS 14, users can opt to have iPhone\u2019s software organize their apps for them instead of manually moving them around into folders. The feature will benefit those who now have multiple pages of apps, and often forget where they\u2019ve organized them on back screens. It also introduces the concept of home screen widgets and lightweight apps, called App Clips.\n\nInstead of pages of apps, the new App Library offers a new space at the end of your home screen where all your apps are organized in one simple and easy-to-navigate view.\n\nTo use the feature, you first go into iPhone\u2019s \u201cjiggle mode\u201d to begin organizing apps. But instead of dragging around icons on the home screen or moving them into folders, you can now check off which pages of apps you want hidden from view. The apps on these pages will end up in your App Library, where apps are organized not only in thematic collections \u2014 like those you would have made, perhaps \u2014 but also into dynamically updated folders.\n\nFor example, a folder called \u201cSuggestions\u201d will house those apps Siri believes you may be looking for next. Another called \u201cRecently Added\u201d will feature apps you\u2019ve recently downloaded. Other folders may include your Apple Arcade downloads, your Social apps, Health & Fitness apps (including Apple\u2019s own Health and Activity apps, for instance), Entertainment apps and so on.\n\nThe apps you use the most from the category will be at the top level for easy launching. In addition, the categories of apps you use most will rise to the top of this screen.\n\nThese categories are automatically created and your apps will be organized for you into the ones where they fit best. These might not be how you would have organized them, necessarily, but it takes the work out of your hands by referencing the app\u2019s existing App Store category to determine its folder. It also offers a way to hide your less-frequently used apps from view.\n\nUp at the top of the App Library, you\u2019ll also have the search field, where you can still get access to all your apps, organized from A to Z.\n\nThe feature was introduced alongside iOS 14 widgets, which lets users \u2014 finally \u2014 surface rich data from within apps in the form of resizable widgets that sit on your home screen. Before, iOS only allowed for widgets in the Today View, but not on its main screen.\n\nIn another more radical change, Apple introduced the concept of App Clips, which can be launched via a visual code or NFC. A clip, like it sounds, is a small part of an app launched on demand. App Clips can include support for Apple Pay, but are small in size to be quickly downloaded in a time of need \u2014 like an app for paying for your parking meter, for instance.\n\nThe idea is not everyone needs a full app download immediately, which takes time. They just need a piece of software that lets you get the job done quickly.\n\nApp Clips will be bundled in with your app in the App Store, similar to how iMessage apps are bundled today \u2014 that is, as an extension of the app, under the same store listing. App Clips are also native code, not web technologies.\n\nWith the App Library, widgets, App Clips, and other iOS 14 features, like picture-and-picture, Apple is giving the iPhone a much-need refresh in terms of its user interface at a time when the format of apps tucked inside folders was becoming a little dated. The features will arrive with iOS 14, which launches publicly later this year.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/ios-14-reimagines-how-you-find-and-use-apps-with-app-clips-widgets-and-an-app-library/"},

The recording indicator will sit in the top bar of your iPhone\u2019s display when your front or rear camera is in use, or if a microphone is active.\n\nBut the biggest changes are for app developers themselves, Apple said. In iOS 14, users will be asked if they want to be tracked by the app. That\u2019s a major change that will likely have a ripple effect: By allowing users to reject tracking, it\u2019ll reduce the amount of data that\u2019s collected, preserving user privacy.\n\nApple also said it will also require app developers to self-report the kinds of permissions that their apps request. This will improve transparency, allowing the user to know what kind of data they may have to give over in order to use the app. It also will explain how that collected data could be tracked outside of the app.\n\nAndroid  users have been able to see app permissions for years on the Google Play app store.\n\nThe move is Apple\u2019s latest assault against the ad industry as part of the tech giant\u2019s privacy-conscious mantra.\n\nThe ad industry has frequently been the target of Apple\u2019s barbs, amid a string of controversies that have embroiled both advertisers and data-hungry tech giants, like Facebook and Google,  which make the bulk of their profits from targeted advertising. As far back as 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook said its Silicon Valley rivals are \u201cgobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it.\u201d Apple, which makes its money selling hardware, \u201celected not to do that,\u201d said Cook.\n\nAs targeted advertising became more invasive, Apple countered by baking in new privacy features to its software, like its intelligence tracking prevention technology and allowing Safari users to install content blockers that prevent ads and trackers from loading.\n\nJust last year Apple told developers to stop using third-party trackers in apps for children or face rejection from the App Store.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/"},

That changes today with a new first-party iOS app called, naturally, Translate, which works with 11 languages, no internet connection required.\n\nThe app is intended for use with speech or short written sentences, not to translate whole web pages or documents. The interface is simple, with a language selector, text field and record button as well as a few extra widgets like favorites and a dictionary.\n\nAt launch Translate will support English, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese and Russian, with others to come. You simply select a pair of languages and paste or record a snippet of text or audio. The translation should show up immediately.\n\nThere\u2019s also a landscape mode that further simplifies the interface:\n\nThe best part is that unlike many translation apps out there, Apple\u2019s is entirely offline, meaning you can use it whether you have a good or bad signal, if you\u2019re out in the middle of nowhere in a country where you don\u2019t get service or if you\u2019re just trying to save data.\n\nThere were no specific release details, so the app will probably appear when you upgrade to iOS 14.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apples-new-translate-app-works-offline-with-11-languages/"},
{"title": "Apple is building its own processors for future Macs", "author": "Brian Heater", "published_at": "2020-06-22 11:34:05", "content": "Apple  just confirmed what is likely the biggest news of today\u2019s WWDC kickoff. Tim Cook officially announced that the company will be producing its own processors for its desktops and laptops \u2014 one of the biggest changes in the company\u2019s long computing history. As has been rumored for years now, Apple is moving away from its reliance on Intel chips, into its own ARM-based.\n\nThe move is the next logical step for a company interested in controlling as many aspects of hardware production as possible. It also follows similar moves on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The company now has several generations of in-house designs for these devices, and it has decided to leverage it for its line computers.\n\nApple contends that its SOCs will be able to provide stronger performance, without sacrificing battery life \u2014 a pretty impressive change, if true. Also on-board is the sort of additional security it has offered on its mobile devices, along with improved graphical performance.\n\nWhat\u2019s more \u2014 as far as Apple is concerned \u2014 this move means its devices use a single processor architecture, which is a big win for cross-platform performance. Unsurprisingly, that also means you\u2019ll be able to run iOS and iPadOS apps directly on the desktop, right out of the box \u2014 a big push forward for all of the work the company has been doing with Catalyst on macOS. Likely, however, they won\u2019t function as well as those native apps.\u00a0\n\nIn spite of the move, however, the company says it\u2019s making it easier for developers to create apps that work on old and new Macs alike \u2014 an important caveat given that it\u2019s going to be a while before most users upgrade. A number of developers, including Microsoft, are already developing for the new architecture.\u00a0\n\nTo ease the transition, Apple\u2019s bringing out a new version of Rosetta \u2014 the program that helped make the transition from Power PC. Rosetta 2 will help make sure that apps that have yet to upgrade will still be able to work on the new processors. These will be key aspects of the newly announced macOS 11 Big Sur.\u00a0\n\nThis being a developer conference, Apple also just announced a Developer Transition Kit to get devs started on the new Macs. The DTK is essentially a souped-up Mac Mini that will give people a head start before the systems actually arrive. The first ARM-based Macs are set to arrive later this year, with the full line transition taking two years. That means there are undoubtedly still some Intel-based systems on the way.\n\nWhile Cook said the company will continue to support the older models, its seems worth holding out on an upgrade to see what the new systems have in store. No specific new systems were announced, but the 13-inch MacBook Pro is expected to be the first system to get the new silicon, with a redesigned iMac expected sometime early next year.\n\nThere are still plenty of unanswered questions on that front. After all, this was a well-polished keynote moving at breakneck speed. The company could only cram in so much. And it seems likely Apple is going to wait on specific product announcements to really drill down on what the new chips will mean in terms of the promised improvements to processing power and battery life.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-is-building-its-own-processors-for-future-macs/"},
{"title": "Apple will let users pick their own default email and browser apps", "author": "Lucas Matney", "published_at": "2020-06-22 11:26:51", "content": "Apple quietly made a major announcement that will change life for users of mobile Chrome, Gmail or Outlook. The company is shifting its view on app defaults and will be allowing users to set different app defaults for their mail and browser apps.\n\nThe company specifically denoted that this feature is coming to iPadOS and iOS 14. This likely means users can designate which browser they\u2019re directed to when they tap a link somewhere. We\u2019ll see whether Apple reserves any functionality for its own services. Rather than highlighting this new feature in the keynote, they snuck it into roundup screens that hovered onscreen for a few seconds. It\u2019s hidden in the bottom center of the screen.\n\nThis is a big change for Apple but it\u2019s no surprise they wouldn\u2019t opt to specifically highlight this onstage. Apple has been reluctant to give users the option to use third-party apps as defaults. The big exception to date has been allowing users early on to set Google  Maps as the default over Apple Maps.\n\nEmail and browsing are huge mobile use cases and it\u2019s surprising that users haven\u2019t had this capability to shift defaults to apps like Chrome or Gmail until this upcoming update. As Apple finds itself at the center of more anti-trust conversations, app defaults has been one area that\u2019s always popped up as a method by which Apple promotes its own services over those from other companies.\n\nDetails are scant in terms of what this feature will look like exactly and what services will boast support, but I imagine we\u2019ll hear more as the betas begin rolling out.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-will-let-users-pick-their-own-default-email-and-browser-apps/"},
{"title": "Google adds contextual fact-checking for some image search results", "author": "Taylor Hatmaker", "published_at": "2020-06-22 11:14:15", "content": "Acknowledging the role that misleadingly edited or out-of-context images play in seeding the internet with misinformation, Google  is introducing fact-checking labels for some Google image searches. The feature, available starting today, provides a few lines of context with select searches, drawing on services provided by third-party fact-checkers. The tool is powered by publishers themselves, who can now opt to tag images that have been fact-checked using ClaimReview, a method for publishers to communicate to search engines that an image has been verified.\n\n\u201cPhotos and videos are an incredible way to help people understand what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Google Product Manager Harris Cohen wrote in a blog post announcing the feature. \u201cBut the power of visual media has its pitfalls\u2060 \u2014 especially when there are questions surrounding the origin, authenticity or context of an image.\u201d\n\nGoogle is definitely right about that. Recirculated images tend to pop-up in most major online conspiracy and viral misinformation cycles, and many credulous internet users are content to believe what they can see \u2014 even if what they\u2019re seeing was edited or otherwise removed from its context.\n\nIn its announcement, Google provided the example of \u201csharks swimming in street Houston,\u201d a query that pulls up a perennial viral image offender. In the example search, a fact-check from PolitiFact appears below the original image of the same shark silhouette swimming in the ocean. The addition is just a few lines of text rather than anything flashier, like a colorful label that might indicate more clearly that the content has a special status.\n\nAccording to Google\u2019s announcement, the labels will pop up on \u201cresults that come from independent, authoritative sources\u201d that meet its standards. The company notes that the inclusion of fact-checking tags won\u2019t elevate those search results. While more fact-checking and additional context is always a good thing, the new image fact-checking tool only reinforces context from third-party sources already doing this fact-checking work rather than surfacing fact-checking on low-quality websites spreading misinformation.\n\nGoogle appears content to lean on third-parties for much of this kind of work rather than bringing it in-house, but the company did trial a more aggressive, hands-on misinformation strategy for COVID-19. In March, Google began scrubbing false claims from search results and pointing users to verified public health information in searches and on YouTube.\n\nIn spite of running one of the most popular social websites in the world, Google has largely steered clear of engaging in the most fractious current conversations around content moderation and misinformation, exemplified by the ongoing standoff between President Trump and his allies and social networks like Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThose companies have signaled opposite strategies toward moderation in recent weeks, with Twitter making increasingly hands-on decisions about what violates its rules while Facebook intervenes only in the most egregious cases. But even if Google mostly succeeds in staying above the fray, the company faces the same existential threat from political figures who seek to punish social media companies by revoking the legal protections that make their businesses possible.\n\nStill, Google did dip its toes into that ongoing conflict last week, when the company confirmed it had removed the right-wing website ZeroHedge from its ad platform for violating its rules against hate and discriminatory content. The company also issued a warning to The Federalist, another far-right site, for similar violations.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/google-image-fact-checking/"},

There are now over 20,000 Watch apps available on the Apple Watch App Store, but what has been missing was the ability to fully use all the data from your favorite apps in a single face on your Watch\u2019s main screen. That\u2019s now changing with watchOS 7, says Apple.\n\nWith the new software, developers will be able to create multiple, custom complications per app, which then can be used to create custom watch faces. For example, a surf app\u2019s developer could create a \u201cSurf Watch\u201d face that shows things like water temperature, swell and wind speed predictions for your favorite beach. Parents can use the Glow Baby app to track changing and feeding times. Nike Run Club can display stats like the pace from your last run and your weekly run goals.\n\nThe developers will be able to build these new complications with SwiftUI, notes Apple.\n\nAlso in watchOS 7, users will be able to share their favorite watch faces that take advantage of all these new custom complications.\n\nIn the watchOS App Store, users will be able to discover curated watch faces from third-party apps. But they can also share watch faces they find on the App Store or elsewhere with family and friends through a new sharing feature.\n\nNow, when you see a watch face you want to share, you just long press on the face to share it and pick a contact to send it to. Developers can also offer preconfigured watch faces right from their apps, and faces can be shared across social media, which could allow for watch faces to go viral in a way they\u2019ve never been able to do before.\n\nThe feature could serve to add vitality to the watch platform whose app ecosystem has lagged behind that of other Apple platforms, like iOS.\n\nApple also says it\u2019s bringing rich complications to more of its own watch faces, including a new chronograph face with a tachometer and an updated XL face.\u00a0", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/watchos-7s-face-sharing-feature-can-help-custom-watch-faces-go-viral/"},
{"title": "The Apple Watch can soon track sleep", "author": "Matt Burns", "published_at": "2020-06-22 11:10:11", "content": "Apple  just announced a long-requested feature for the Apple Watch: sleep tracking. With this new feature, users can not only track sleep but create what Apple says is a holistic approach to improving sleep.\n\nThe sleep-tracking function works in conjunction with an iPhone to help a person create a better sleep routine. This feature is called Wind Down and is designed to reduce distractions on the iPhone and Apple Watch. When activated, the phone displays additional information on the lock screen, including how long it is until bedtime (pre-set by the user), and turns on Do Not Disturb. This screen prompts users to relax and meditate \u2014 instead of, you know, endlessly scrolling Reddit. When it\u2019s time to wake up, the alarm screen has been reworked and now features a link to Shortcuts, making it easier to launch daily apps.\n\nOn the Apple Watch, when Wind Down is activated, the user\u2019s default complication is replaced by a simple watch face.\n\nTo track sleep, the Apple Watch follows the user\u2019s micro-movements and the rise and fall of the user\u2019s breath. This information can be displayed on the Apple Watch or iPhone.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Apple\u2019s first foray into sleep tracking. In 2017, the company purchased the company Beddit, a device that goes on a mattress and tracks the user\u2019s sleep. That company is still operating and available for purchase. At this time, it\u2019s unclear if any technology or strategy is shared between the two parts of Apple.\n\nSleep tracking will come to iOS 14 and watchOS 7 later this year. The iPhone portion works independently from the Watch version, allowing users without an Apple Watch to still utilize the bedtime and wake-up features.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/the-apple-watch-can-soon-track-sleep/"}
